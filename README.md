# <a name="project-1"></a> **🔬 Project 1 — Industrial Biotechnology: Batch Fermentation & Insulin Production**

### **Summary**
This project explored the industrial‑scale production of insulin using **batch fermentation** with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. It covered insulin biology, fermentation theory, bioreactor design, and a complete **mass balance** to determine substrate requirements.

### **Key Learning Areas**
- Industrial insulin production workflow  
- Batch vs fed‑batch vs continuous modes  
- Fermenter design: aeration, agitation, baffles, sensors  
- **Full carbon & mass balance**  
- Use of OD → biomass conversion  
- Glucose requirement for large‑scale insulin fermentation

### **Major Results**
- OD → biomass: **3.5 kg** total yeast in final reactor  
- Carbon balance across proteins, RNA, glycogen  
- Total glucose required: **≈4.46 tonnes**  
- Effects of oxygen, pH, and feeding on insulin yield

### **My Contribution**
- Wrote fermentation & process sections  
- Performed full mass balance calculation  
- Analyzed fermentation parameters & metabolic considerations

# <a name="project-2"></a> **🧪 Project 2 — Applied Microbiology: Co‑Digestion of Algae & Sludge for Biogas**

### **Summary**
This study evaluated whether combining microalgae (*Chlorella sorokiniana*) with activated sludge increases methane yield during **anaerobic digestion**. Gas chromatography and statistical modelling were used to evaluate performance.

### **What We Did**
- Designed six‑flask AD experiment  
- Measured CH₄ % and volume using GC  
- Calculated methane yield (mL CH₄ / g VS)  
- Paired T‑test, F‑test, logarithmic regression  
- Compared theoretical vs experimental yields

### **Key Findings**
- Pure algae produced *more methane* than algae + sludge  
- But difference **not statistically significant** (p > 0.05)  
- Sludge composition variability influenced inconsistency  
- Algae matched theoretical yield (high accuracy)

### **My Contribution**
- Wrote Introduction, ATS system, AD theory, and factors affecting biogas  
- Calculated methane yields and theoretical predictions  
- Interpreted statistical results

# <a name="project-3"></a> **🧫 Project 3 — Applied Fermentation: Comparing Glucose vs Glycerol in E. coli JM109**

### **Summary**
This project compared **glucose vs glycerol** as carbon sources for *E. coli* JM109 in both shake flasks and 2 L bioreactors. Growth was analyzed using optical density, CO₂ accumulation, CDW, plate counts, and pH changes.

### **Results**
| Parameter | Glucose | Glycerol |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Specific growth rate (µ)** | 0.5392 | 0.3616 |
| **Doubling time (h)** | 1.29 h | 1.92 h |
| **Growth stability** | High until pH failure | Stable throughout |

### **Challenges**
- pH control error (two acid bottles connected)  
- Sampling contamination risk  
- Tubing blockage during glycerol sampling  

### **Conclusion**
Glucose supports faster growth, but glycerol is still a **valid and sustainable carbon source**, especially as a biodiesel by‑product.

### **My Contribution**
- Prepared media, inoculum, and fermentation systems  
- Wrote methodology (OD, CDW, HPLC, plate counts)  
- Analyzed errors and limitations

# <a name="project-4"></a> **🟧 Project 4 — Downstream Processing: Industrial Extraction of β‑Carotene from *Dunaliella salina***

### **Summary**
A full industrial‑scale downstream process was designed for extracting **β‑carotene** from *D. salina* using:

- Raceway ponds (upstream)  
- Stacked‑disc centrifugation  
- Bead milling  
- Liquid‑liquid extraction using soybean oil  
- Microfiltration  
- Packaging

Mass balances and economic modeling were executed using **SuperPro Designer®**.

### **Key Results**
- Annual β‑carotene: **7.87 tonnes**  
- Final product: **30% β‑carotene in soybean oil**  
- Annual revenue: **$33.5 million**  
- Net profit: **$15.4 million / year**  
- Payback period: **1.69 years**  
- Extraction yield: **92.52%**

### **My Contribution**
- Wrote sections on carotenoids, D. salina biology, downstream processes  
- Ran SPD simulations and mass balances  
- Co‑developed economic evaluation and final conclusions
